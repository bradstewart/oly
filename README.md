# o*l*y

Set of libraries to create well-written [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) applications with [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Browsers.

The set is based on known projects, such as [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

### Why

- hide the complexity of server-side rendering
- make code between client and server consistency
- easily and quickly test everything
- unify contexts into one single class
